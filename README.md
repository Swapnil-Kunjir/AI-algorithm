# AI-algorithm

In this I will upload some of the AI algorithms that I have used for practice learning

1. Genetic algorithm (used for optimal solution )</br>

Note- For some cases it depends on initial population. Sometimes we get solution itself in initial population but if initial solution is bad it might take you more time to reach solution.
